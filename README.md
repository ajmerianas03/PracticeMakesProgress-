# PracticeMakesProgress

Welcome to **PracticeMakesProgress**! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to my journey of continuous improvement in coding. After completing the [101 Days of Code](https://github.com/ajmerianas03/101DaysOfCodeJourney), I'm taking it a step further by solving coding challenges, learning new concepts, and expanding my programming knowledge.

This repository will serve as a place where I track my practice, solve algorithmic problems, and document my learning process as I continue to improve.

## Why This Repository?

This project is all about self-improvement. As I work through problems and challenges from various platforms like **CodeChef**, I’ll document my progress and solutions. The goal is to become a better programmer each day through consistent practice and problem-solving.

## What Will You Find Here?

- **Daily coding challenges** 🧩
- **Solutions to CodeChef problems** 🖥️
- **Algorithmic and data structure challenges** 🔍
- **Project work and exercises** 💻
